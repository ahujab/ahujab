I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about learning new technologies. Always intrigued by visualizing how novel real-world problems can be solved just by critical thinking and innovation, nothing matters more than just acting at the right time. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, node.js and GraphQL.
